##Message in a Bottle

A messaging-centered social network meant to evoke the romantic notion of finding a message in a bottle on the beach.

Built with React.js, MaterialUI, MongoDB (Mongoose), Passport.js and Webpack, among others.

The live site can be found at https://message-in-a-bottle-app.herokuapp.com/.

My responsibilities on this project included database architecture using [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) and building routes using [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).
